# JWKNZ Docs

In my [GitHub Account](https://github.com/jwknz) and this [Github Account](https://github.com/to-jk11) I have bunch of howto repositories.
I might do something more with them one day, but for now they are just code examples.

This site serves to provide some documentation for them.

To navigate your way through the different tutorials, follow the naviagtion in the left menu.

!!! note "Content"
    All tutorials are written by [me](https://github.com/jwknz)
    and are free for you to learn from. 

    If I use some specific information from a site or person - I will credit them.


I use GitHub for my repositories, so I will refer to GitHub by name, but if you use a service like BitBucket or GitLab, just exchange the details where relevant.
